### Our role

I worked on the Belixa Driver project to digitalize the concrete delivery process. Concrete truck drivers receive their delivery orders on an Android tablet, streamlining tasks, providing execution support, and optimizing workflows to enable automated client billing. The application is currently used by over 300 truck drivers across the country.

Additionally, I developed a client portal where customers can track their ongoing deliveries with real-time truck geolocation and estimated arrival times.
