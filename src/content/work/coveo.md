### Project context

Coveo, a company that provides customer service solutions, has upgraded its insight panel feature to make it easier to configure and implement. 

The company used a low-code/no-code approach to simplify the process and reduce the need for external technical support. 

Coveo created a graphical user interface (GUI) builder that allows non-technical users to configure an Insight Panel from start to finish.

Coveo hopes that the GUI builder will empower users to easily and quickly create a proof-of-concept search page using their own indexed content.

The new Insight Panel Builder aims to put the power in the hands of new and non-technical users, allowing them to create and modify the latest version of the insight panel and its components.
