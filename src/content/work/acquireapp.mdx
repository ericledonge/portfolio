### Project context

Acquire App, a California-based startup, enlisted the expertise of Kumojin, a digital product development company, to develop their product: a one page e-commerce platform.

Acquire offers dynamic landing pages that allow businesses to personalize the buying experience for customers. 

The pages enable businesses to use Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, or Google Ads to drive sales with native discounts, subscriptions, pre/post-purchase upsells, and a frictionless checkout experience. 

Businesses can create exclusive on-page discounts and pre/post-purchase funnels with customizable triggers based on customer behavior. 

They can also add a subscription management system and personalize emails and SMS to improve sales and increase ROI. 

With pre-authentication technology, the Acquire App can fast track the checkout process and pre-fill personal information for a seamless shopping experience.
