### Project context

Track Plow is a SaaS that helps snow plow operators to inform their customers about their snow clearing tours.

### Our role

I developed the mobile application for Track Plow operator which localizes the snow clearing tour information to the customers' location.

Additionally, I developed a client portal where customers can track their ongoing snow clearing tours with real-time snow plow geolocation and estimated arrival times.

### My contribution

Development of a React native application with Expo and EAS.

Development of the client portal with Next.js and React Server Components, hosted on Vercel.

### Technological Stack
