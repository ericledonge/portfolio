### Project context

Beneva was born from the merger of two major insurers: La Capitale and SSQ.

Beneva needed to quickly provide its customers with a mobile application that would allow them to present their insurance cards in pharmacies, consult the details of their insurance policies or make claims online.

This project was strategically important for Beneva's brand image. A major marketing campaign accompanied the launch of the application.
