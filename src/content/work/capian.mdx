### Project context

Capian is an all-in-one tool that simplifies the UI/UX audit and review process for teams.

It offers various features to help teams categorize their findings, make their team aware of UX best practices, identify improvements for their development team, capture inspirations, document business interfaces and processes, and streamline their interface review process.

Capian's mobile app make it easy to take screenshots and make annotations while browsing, and its team collaboration feature facilitates discussions directly within the tool.

### Our role

The React Native environment is a very dynamic environment and the current application was no longer functional. Apple had even removed the application from its store because of its lack of maintenance.

### My contribution

My contribution consisted in redeveloping the application with current standards such as Expo meta-framework, React hooks and modern JavaScript.

I did the entire redevelopment of the application by myself and I assisted the Capian manager in the build and submission of the application to the App Store, via the Expo Application Services solution.
